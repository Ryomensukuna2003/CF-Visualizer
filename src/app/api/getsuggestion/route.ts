    Problem Distribution by Rating: ${userData.barGraphData}
 Provide the following sections in a well-structured markdown format:

1. **Problem Rating Focus**:
   - Analyze the problem ratings where the user has solved fewer problems.
   - Suggest specific rating ranges (e.g., 1300-1500, 1600-1800) where they should focus to improve their overall rating.
   
2. **Topic Recommendations**:
   - Based on the user's performance, suggest competitive programming topics (e.g., dynamic programming, graphs, data structures) that they should focus on.
   - Relate each topic to their weak rating areas. For example, if the user struggles with problems rated 1600+, recommend more advanced topics like "Segment Trees" or "Dynamic Programming on Trees".
   
3. **Consistency Advice**:
   - Evaluate the user's consistency based on the total vs. solved problems.
   - Provide specific suggestions for practicing regularly (e.g., solve at least 5 problems each week from the 1600-1800 range).
   
4. **Learning from Mistakes**:
   - Identify areas where the user has attempted many problems but solved few.
   - Recommend reviewing those problem types and topics. Suggest reattempting the hardest problems they failed to solve and learning from editorial solutions.

5. **Next Steps**:
   - Encourage the user to push through challenges in harder topics.
   - Recommend participating in more contests (e.g., at least 2 per month) and tracking their progress.
   

Ensure the advice is concise, actionable, and tailored to the user's current progress level and be a little bit sarcastic too ðŸ˜‰.`;
